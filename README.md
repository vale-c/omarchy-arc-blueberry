Run the following command to install directly from GitHub:
```
omarchy-theme-install https://github.com/vale-c/omarchy-arc-blueberry
```

This will automatically place the theme in your Omarchy themes directory.

## Customization
Edit files directly (e.g., `hyprland.conf` for border tweaks, `chromium.theme` for browser seeds), then reselect in Omarchy to apply. For VSCode, the `vscode.json` handles extension/theme sync automatically.
